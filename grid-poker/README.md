# GRID POKER

**Poker, reimagined as a tactical grid.**

GRID POKER is a turn-based poker puzzle where hands are built spatially on a 5×5 grid.  
Rows, columns, and diagonals become strategic choices instead of bets.

There’s no bluffing, no gambling mechanics, and no hidden math — just clear decisions and readable outcomes.
